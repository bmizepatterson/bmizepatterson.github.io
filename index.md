<p>My name's Ben Patterson, and I like to build things. As an <em>educator</em>, I build safe learning communities. As a <em>writer</em>, I build images in the reader's imagination. And as a <em>web developer</em>, I build pathways to information.</p>

<p>I'm a certified Latin teacher who has taught for ten years in online and classroom environments. My formal training is in education, but I'm an autodidact programmer and website builder. Currently, I'm improving my web development skills through <a href="https://www.awesomeincu.com/bootcamp/" target="_blank" {{ site.ext_link_rel }}>Awesome Inc's Developer Bootcamp</a>.</p>
