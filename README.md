This site is powered by Jekyll. To run in a development environment, run `bundle exec jekyll serve` from the project root.

This site is hosted by GitHub Pages. To publish, simply push to the `master` branch of the [bmizepatterson.github.io](https://github.com/bmizepatterson/bmizepatterson.github.io) repo.

The index page is `index.md` contains little but the layout declaration. (It's the only page that uses the `home` layout, which can be found in /_layouts/home.html.) Any additional content will appear above the content in that layout.
