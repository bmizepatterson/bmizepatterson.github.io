Jekyll makes it easy to list out, say, all of the projects I have in my portfolio. But since each project takes up quite a bit of space, I wanted to find a way to display one at a time, with "next" and "previous" buttons for pagination. Something like this:

![Portfolio Page Mock-up]({{ "/assets/img/portfolio-page.png" | relative_url }})
