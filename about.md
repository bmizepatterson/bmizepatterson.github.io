My name's Ben Patterson, and I like to build things. As an *educator*, I build safe learning communities. As a *writer*, I build images in the reader's imagination. And as a *web developer*, I build pathways to information.

I'm a certified Latin teacher who has taught for ten years in online and classroom environments. My formal training is in education, but I'm an autodidact[^1] programmer and website builder. Currently, I'm improving my web development skills through <a href="https://www.awesomeincu.com/bootcamp/" target="_blank" {{ site.ext_link_rel }}>Awesome Inc's Developer Bootcamp</a>.

[^1]: Just savor this delicious word: <a href="https://www.dictionary.com/browse/autodidact" target="_blank" {{ site.ext_link_rel }}>Aw-toh-<strong>dahy</strong>-dakt</a>. Love it.
