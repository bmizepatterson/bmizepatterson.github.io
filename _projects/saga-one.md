description: <p>SagaOne is a turn-based shared journal application. You can create a journal, invite friends to join it, and take turns writing in it. The journal automatically passes from person to person after a set period of time. For example, you can create a journal that rotates to the next user every day, every week, or every month.</p><p>Only the person who has the journal can read it. When it's your turn with a journal, you can write new entries, read previous entries, and even add comments to previous entries.</p><p>SagaOne leverages the power of the Internet to create community regardless of distance, while fostering a small but fosters a small, intimate environment. It's a great way to share your life and build a sense of connection with others!</p>
